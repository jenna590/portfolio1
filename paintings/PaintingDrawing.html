   <h3>Tools: acrylic paint and photo collage<br><br>
     The assignment for this project was to create a composite piece that is made up of my answers to the teaching questions of <a href="http://classes.dma.ucla.edu/Fall16/173/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Thek-Teaching-Notes.pdf">Paul Thek</a>, an American sculptor, painter and installation artist. My choice to create a self portrait was based on my belief that the answers illustrated a reflection of myself and how my upbringing, environment, and experiences up to that point shaped my thinking. Not to mention, the isolation I felt during this time as it was around the one-year mark since the pandemic really took center stage on our lives.  </h3>
