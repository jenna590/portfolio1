   <h3> Tools: HTML, CSS, GitHub Pages<br><br>This project is a digital archive of family portraits that I created to memorialize my family's history in the Soviet Union through their immigration to the United States. I'm deeply inspired by the stories of my ancestors and wanted to build a website that housed these keepsakes for as long as the World Wide Web exits. <br><br> With absolutely no prior experience coding with HTML or CSS, I set forth on a journey that involved a lot of youtube tutorials and Google searches. Working on this website is what ultimately peaked my interest to further my familiarity with web development tools.  </h3>
