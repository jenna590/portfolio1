   <h3> Tools: HTML, CSS, GitHub Pages<br><br>Early-mid 2020, I found myself spending the beginning of the pandemic living in my childhood home. Out of sheer boredom, I would look through old keepsakes which included photographs taken of my family members when they lived in the Soviet Union. Like many other children of immigrants, growing up I often heard stories of what life was like during the times pictured in these photographs. For my 2020 fall semester archival project, I collected their portraits and organized them into a virtural family photo album.<br><br> With absolutely no prior experience coding with HTML or CSS, I set forth on a journey that involved a lot of youtube tutorials and Google searches. Working on this website is what ultimately peaked my interest to learn more about web development/design.  </h3>
